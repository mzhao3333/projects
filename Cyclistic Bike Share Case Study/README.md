# Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study

## Introduction

This is the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study that is assigned as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course from Coursera.

The goal of this case study is to use the data analysis process which includes ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act on a real life business problem.

## Scenario

We are a junior data analyst working at a fictional bike-share company in Chicago named Cyclistic. We believe that maximizing the number of annual memberships will help the company succeed. Our goal is to understand how casual and annual members use our bikes differently and design a strategy to convert casual riders into annual members based on these insights.

## Data Context

We acquire our monthly data for the year 2022 from this link: [Click here to see divvy-tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

The data is made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).



Coincidentally, this is an interesting dataset for me to work with as I currently reside in Chicago and I see these divvy bikes quite often.
